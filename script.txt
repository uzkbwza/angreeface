peasant (to player): 
dear vagrant, i beseech you! liberate 
our honest township from its blight; what greed,
these bugs, that one might reap the harvest of 
their countrymen? a beast's, no more, no less. 
must we too hunger? bogus!

butterfly: 
dost not thou wot my nature? let me tell:
in party born a delicate inching wimp
then stolen of its youth by endless sleep,
emerg√©d but to fall by season's end,
a chitin husk belie its feeble heart.
this parchment wing that blazons nature's word,
by gale and zephyr set acourse, it is
my order and my fate.
then how dost thou suggest an insect dine? 
beneath a thatch? by candlelight? like men?
nay, i resign to play the pest for thee.
i make no plea to Truth.

peasant:
forsooth! the parasite admits his theft.
pray hear my woeful tale, adventurer;
know well to trust a man above a midge.
and furthermore, awaiteth on our ills 
a mangled wretch, who feasteth on my sib,
whose cavern lieth past the boundary
of 
our children do not play but hide in fear,
their mothers widow'd by this devil. fie!
should we no strength to fight? no flesh upon
our gyatt? we waste to nought!

aid peasant? (tap for yea, hold for nay)

yea

butterfly: 'tis so. have at thee!

*you suplex the approaching butterfly*

seasons later...
